      <h3>About Me;</h3><br>
      <p>Hello!<br> I am a student at Nile University of Nigeria, majoring in Computer Science. Even though, I study in this major, I am a self-taught artist, who started drawing at a very young age. <br> I had a passion for drawing since I was a little kid, and with the help of a friend, I constanly drew and eventually improved myself in this field. <br> First it started with color pencils then I learned to use more materials, now I enjoy watercolors and I can say that, coloring with them is so fun for me, so I can say that I am a watercolor artist. <br> However, I didn't stop there, once I saw the digital drawing enviroment, I became a fan of those artists and begun to work in that field as well. I can say I'm not profecional yet, but I'm still learning. <br> And at last, but not least, I've started to model 3D object and chracters using Blender app with the help of Rais Games.</p>
